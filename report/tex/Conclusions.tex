\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, this study investigates the feasibility of integrating ultrasonic sensors as a secondary sensing modality to current mapping stacks in robotics. The study developed simulation environments, implemented sensor fusion mechanisms, and designed a RANSAC-based approach for window segmentation. The combination of depth cameras as the primary sensing device and sonar data as heuristic information can provide better safety and environmental understanding for robot navigation.
